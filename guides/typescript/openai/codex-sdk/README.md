# Codex Agent

## Overview

This example runs an [OpenAI Codex](https://chatgpt.com/features/codex) agent inside a Northrays sandbox. You can interact with the agent via the CLI to run automations, build apps, and launch web apps or services using [Northrays preview links](https://www.northrays.com/docs/en/preview-and-authentication/#fetching-a-preview-link).

> Note: In this example, your OpenAI API key is passed into the sandbox environment and may be accessible to any code executed within it.

## Features

- **Secure sandbox execution:** The agent operates within a controlled environment, along with code or commands run by the agent.
- **Codex integration:** Includes the full abilities of the Codex SDK, including reading and editing code files, and running shell commands.
- **Preview deployed apps:** Use Northrays preview links to view and interact with your deployed applications.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js:** Version 18 or higher is required

## Environment Variables

To run this example, you need to set the following environment variables:

- `NORTHRAYS_API_KEY`: Required for access to Northrays sandboxes. Get it from [Northrays Dashboard](https://app.northrays.com/dashboard/keys)
- `SANDBOX_OPENAI_API_KEY`: Required to run Codex. Get it from [OpenAI Developer Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)

Create a `.env` file in the project directory with these variables.

## Getting Started

### Setup and Run

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Run the example:

   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

## How It Works

When this example is run, the agent follows the following workflow:

1. A new Northrays sandbox is created.
2. The coding agent is installed and launched inside the sandbox.
3. User queries are passed to the agent, and the result is displayed to the user.
4. When the script is terminated, the sandbox is deleted.
