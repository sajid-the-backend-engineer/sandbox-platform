# Amp Code Coding Agent with Northrays

A coding agent powered by the [Amp Code CLI](https://ampcode.com/) running inside secure [Northrays sandboxes](https://www.northrays.com/).

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18 or newer
- A Northrays API key from [Northrays Dashboard](https://app.northrays.com/dashboard/keys)
- An Amp API key from [Amp Settings](https://ampcode.com/settings)
- **Amp paid credits** - Execute mode requires paid credits. [Add credits here](https://ampcode.com/pay)

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and add your API keys:

   ```bash
   NORTHRAYS_API_KEY=your_northrays_key
   SANDBOX_AMP_API_KEY=your_amp_key
   ```

## Usage

Run the agent:

```bash
npm run start
```

The agent gets a Northrays-aware system prompt: sandbox context, the preview URL pattern, and instructions to write server startup commands to `/home/northrays/start.sh` instead of executing them directly in Amp.

The agent will:

1. Create a Northrays sandbox
2. Install the Amp CLI in the sandbox
3. Start an interactive prompt loop using CLI-per-turn mode with thread continuity
4. If `/home/northrays/start.sh` exists after a turn, run it via a Northrays process session command

Example session:

```
$ npm run start
Creating sandbox...
Installing Amp CLI...
Starting Amp Code...

Agent ready. Press Ctrl+C at any time to exit.

## Features

- Secure, isolated execution in Northrays sandboxes
- Amp CLI with streaming JSON output for real-time updates
- Thread-based session continuity across multiple turns
- Automatic cleanup on exit

## How It Works

This example uses a PTY (pseudo-terminal) to stream output from Amp CLI, running one command per user turn with thread-based session continuity:

1. A PTY is created for streaming output from Amp commands
2. First prompt: Run `amp --dangerously-allow-all --stream-json -m smart -x "prompt"` and capture the thread ID from the streaming JSON init message
3. Follow-up prompts: Run `amp --dangerously-allow-all --stream-json -m smart -x "prompt" threads continue <thread-id>`
4. If the thread ID isn't captured from the stream, fall back to parsing `amp threads list` text output
5. Each command streams JSON output for real-time display of assistant messages and tool usage
